# Rock Paper Scissors: An Introductory JavaScript Project

## Overview
This project forms part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations Course. Following a brief introduction to the basics of JavaScript, you are tasked to create a simple game of "rock, paper, scissors" that can be played inside a browser console. This is my attempt to complete this project.

The purpose of this project is twofold. The first is to provide you with an opportunity to practice writing and using JavaScript. The second, arguably more important purpose, is to practice taking an algorithmic approach to problem solving (as outlined in the "Problem Solving" lesson in the course). 

Note that when developing this game, the focus was on ensuring it was operational within the Google Chrome browser. It may still function correctly in other browsers, however, there is no guarantee that it will.

## The Game
If you're interesting in testing the game, please ensure you're using the Google Chrome browser to ensure it functions as intended.

To play the game, please visit the following website and open the browser console: 

To open the console in Google Chrome, choose one of the following options:
1. Right-click on the page, click on **Inspect** from the menu, then navigate to the tab.
2. Alternatively, use the following shortcut:
    * For Mac: cmd + option + J
    * For Windows, Linux, ChromeOS: ctrl + shift + J
